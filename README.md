# Learning-Full-Stack

My attempt to follow along with the The Complete Developer book (No Starch Press).

For documentation files, kindly refer to:

- [Improvements wishlist](/docs/improvements-wishlist.md)
- [Known issues](/docs/known-issues.md)

Highly recommend visiting [Humble Bundle Books](https://www.humblebundle.com/books) to acquire programming books at discounted prices.

# Planned improvements for my 2026 revisit and continuation:

- [ ] Continue the read through of the book up to Part II. From what I recall, my 2025 pass of the book only covered Part I and only lightly touched on Part II where book covers creating "The Food Finder" Application.
- [ ] Reacreate the "The Food Finder" application using a different stack, and possibly diverge from the book and continue it as it's own standalone project. Current technology stack wishlist
  - [Bun](https://bun.sh/) or [Deno](https://deno.com/)
  - [Vite](https://vite.dev/)
  - [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)
  - [Astro.js](https://astro.build/)
  - [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/index.html)
  - [Hono](https://hono.dev/)
  - [Podman](https://podman.io/)
  - [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/)
  - [OpenAuth](https://openauth.js.org/)
- [ ] To prepare for the above, already attempt to recreate the examples provided in the book with the above stack where possible. I am somewaht already familiar with some concepts or technologies through my experience at work, and I may safely give them less emphasis.

A more complete list of potential ideas to pick up can be found in the [Improvements wishlist](/docs/improvements-wishlist.md) docs.
