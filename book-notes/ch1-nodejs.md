# Personal notes:

- Generally covers that basics that I've learned hands-on at my professional developer role.
- This chapter covers:
  - How to install Node.js (recommends LTS)
  - What is the `npm` command?
  - What `package.json`?
    - `name` and `version` fields are required
    - Semantic versioning
    - `dependencies` vs. `devDependencies`
    - `package-lock.json` file
  - Creating a project
    - `npm init`

# Individual notes:

- The `package-lock.json` is meant to address the way npm only notes the major versions when installing a fresh project (?). This is somehow meant to address that by allowing npm to create an exact clone of the setup.
