# Potential improvements wishlist

> [!NOTE]
> Given that the project is mainly for learning purposes, these are just my broad ideas that I may or may not incorporate in the future.

## Highlighted in README.md 2026 revisit and continuation

- [ ] Revisit the applications created in 2025, but skip the part that includes GraphQL and MongoDb for when I will go over them again in the book.
- [ ] Continue the read through of the book up to Part II. From what I recall, my 2025 pass of the book only covered Part I and only lightly touched on Part II where book covers creating "The Food Finder" Application.
- [ ] Reacreate the "The Food Finder" application using a different stack, and possibly diverge from the book and continue it as it's own standalone project. Current technology stack wishlist
  - [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
  - [Hono](https://hono.dev/)
  - [OpenAuth](https://openauth.js.org/)
  - [Podman](https://podman.io/)
  - [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/index.html)
  - [TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start/latest) or [Astro.js](https://astro.build/)
    - Went with TanStack Start since the concepts apear to be more trasnferable given that Astro is primarily for SSG, which is more ideal for marketing sites/pages. Will try my best to pick up Astro later, though!
    - <mark>Will pick this up later after I've gone through more of the changes to be made to the next application.</mark>
    - Might also want to learn this separately as it's own repo ([Learning-Tanstack](https://github.com/julillermo/Learning-TanStack))
  - [tRPC](https://trpc.io/)
  - [Vite](https://vite.dev/)
  - [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)
  - [Astro.js](https://astro.build/) or [TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start/latest)
  - [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/index.html)
  - [Hono](https://hono.dev/)
  - [Podman](https://podman.io/)
  - [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/)
  - [OpenAuth](https://openauth.js.org/)
- [ ] To prepare for the above, I plan to already attempt to recreate the examples provided in the book with the above stack in my 2026 revisit, where possible. I may have already gained experience through my professional work where I go less into detail during my passthrough.

## Other ideas

- [ ] Try a different front-end framework such as Vue, Svelte, or Solid.
- [ ] Deploy the resulting project in a visible manner.
- [ ] Explore recreating the project in Python:
  - [ ] [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
  - [ ] [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/)
  - [ ] [FastApi](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
- [ ] It might also be worthwhile to go about updating dependencies to their latest versions for the learning experience of updating and "reviving" an application
  - Updating React-FE (uses vite) to the latest versions
